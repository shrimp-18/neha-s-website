        <strong><h2>About Me</h2></strong>
        <p>Hey there!</p>
        <p>I'm a 17 year old girl born in Dehradun,India. I got my primary,middle and high school education from Ann
          Mary School,Dehradun. I'd call myself a flâneur (/flaˈnəː/ noun: a person who saunters around observing society.)
          Since childhood i have felt emotions much more deeply than others. I often get lost in moments!
         Out of my infine hobbies, one of the things i like to do the most is people watching; it brings me an odd joy
        which nothing else does. I've also been told that i have insane memory; I remember moments to the 
      tiniest detail event after years have passed. I almost never forget people whom i liked even for a tiny moment.
    I believe in fate and manifestation; you'd often find me praying at 11:11 and getting super excited when
  coincidences happen. I fall in love with people, places and things easily. For me love has never been a restrictive concept; instead
i believe our sole purpose in life is to love as much as we can, deeply ! I've loved many people and things in life 
and i hope to love more !</p>
